It's likely that apps containing characters past 127 are not English language apps and can be discarded.\n",

The function will first parse out the characters in the app and, using the `ord()` function, check each one to determine if it is English or not based on it's `ord()` value.

    "Genre itself does not provide us enough information to determine what makes a successful app. But it does give narrow down the categories our apps should compete in. There is an interesting distinction of popular categories between the two markets. In the App Store, Games are clearly the top category. But in Google Play, we see that more practical genres like Tools, Business, Education, are comparable to Entertainment. Overall, apps on the Google Play store tend to be more balanced than solely focused on entertainment."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project consisted of collecting and analyzing app data for Google Play and the Apple App Store to determine a potential app profile and market for our company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alot of steps were taken to clean the data and target our analysis to comparable apps. This included constraints to only free and English language apps. Once our data was clean, we determined popular genres by examining number of apps and average number of installs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our findings showed the most popular categories for each market which included Social Networking, Games, and Reference genres. Among these, we determined the potential categories we primarily dominated with well-established market leaders such as Facebook, Youtube, and Google's suite of apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Reference category showed potential within both markets though. There are a few market leaders such as the Bible and Kindle. However most of the popular apps in this category are readers or processors, not actual reference materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommendation from these findings is that the company create an app for a specific book or popular piece of reference material. Beyond the text though, the app should include additional features such as audio files, trivia, built-in dictionary, or even forums. An example app could be one designed around research topics for college students."
